# meteorite-madness
This project is my first unity project, and was purely made for myself to test how unity works, where i made use of:
- Player movement (Looking around, sprinting, jumping)
- Randomly spawning objects
- Spawned objects automatically despawn after 5 seconds
- Game over screen when player interacts with spawned object
- Pass "timer" variable from one scene to the other
- Testing how collisions work
